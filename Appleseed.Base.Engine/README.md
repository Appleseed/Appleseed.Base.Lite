Appleseed Base : Engine

This is the console application that runs the engine for the Appleseed Base system. It will be refactored into a combination of a console application, scheduled task, and a windows service. 
It initially started as a general reference tutorial application for folks wanting to see best practices of .NET in a knowledge management / portal / integration/ search project.
