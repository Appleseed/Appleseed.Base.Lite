Appleseed Base : Web

This is the web layer for the Appleseed Base system. It will be used to view, manage, and eventually execute the Base engine in realtime. 
It initially started as a general reference tutorial application for folks wanting to see best practices of .NET in a knowledge management / portal / integration/ search project.
